Sometimes I wouldn’t fully regain consciousness until I was standing in the apartment’s drab living room in my underwear, thinking I could hear the snake hiss of the Livingston faucet, almost louder than the drone of my own problems. And then, after my parole expired—after I had scaled my life back and back and back, shrunk my water footprint down as small as I could—I would kill myself. Almost none of us are willing to make choices about how many children to have or whether to fly on airplanes with our carbon or water footprints in mind, but we’re happy to continue recycling—an activity so ineffectual by comparison that we shouldn’t even bother.

Before I became the insufferable type of person who knows it takes a gallon of water to produce a single almond, I was a twentysomething state prison inmate, listening to the sound of a running faucet. Well Without Water
Haunted by a running tap in prison, a man grows obsessed with water waste and climate change, pushing him to the edge. Most bathroom sinks at Livingston had metering faucets with stout knobs you had to press to keep the water running. Whatever time you’re reading this, whatever year, somewhere in America—all over America—a faucet is running in a prison bathroom, to hide the sounds of a man masturbating. Every morning at Livingston, I passed the dorm bathroom with a sleeve of Pop-Tarts in hand, on my way to get in line for the overworked toaster, and that one faucet was running. But proximity is powerful, and of all the environmental crises that could serve as the poster child for the Anthropocene, the crisis I couldn’t shake, the one I could almost quantify, was that bathroom faucet.
