“I’ll feel like hell the next morning but it’ll be worth it.” In either case, to walk around America’s largest Superfund site presents three major risks. This place promised a bountiful life, a bestselling action novel fast paced and plotted in vice, a Rocky Mountain casino met with a patriotic call to arm the war machine, to electrify freedom! Everything changed following World War II, when advancements in open-pit mining technology developed elsewhere and Butte couldn’t compete, as the city literally sat atop its wealth. Over the next two decades, the pit produced 320 million tons of ore, 700 million tons of waste rock, and enough pure copper to pave a four-lane freeway from Butte to Salt Lake City. The Anaconda Copper Company would eventually fold after Chile nationalized their mining operations in 1971. It had previously been removing several million gallons daily from underground shafts, and now the mines filled with contaminated water, which also filled the pit. With fish kills and widespread health concerns over a hundred miles downstream, in 1987, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated Butte/Silver Bow Creek a Superfund site, the single largest environmental cleanup designation in US history. It wasn’t until the US Treasury began minting copper coins to replace bronze ones that everything changed. Their children had no interest in this history either, and played tag under an aspen tree as we followed Cincinnati Matt to the underground portal, a corrugated metal tube set diagonally into the hillside and wide enough to swallow a school bus. To connect solar amps to municipal grids requires heavy demands of conduction—a well-designed solar photovoltaic plant, for example, might use nine thousand pounds of copper per megawatt.
