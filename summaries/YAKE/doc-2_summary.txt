Upper Silver Bow Creek is the headwaters, our start and finish point, previously unadulterated until mining operations severed its flow. Around The Pit

A great blue heron spears for minnows at the confluence of upper Silver Bow and Blacktail creeks, and Joe stands in the parking lot next to his pickup wearing a faded yellow ball cap, blue jeans, and a jean shirt. Joe understands the data, and he understands the danger, having worked here at the largest Superfund site in America for the past two decades. “I’ll feel like hell the next morning but it’ll be worth it.” In either case, to walk around America’s largest Superfund site presents three major risks.

Long before Europeans arrived here, the Snt’apqey, or Silver Bow Creek, offered abundance to the Indigenous Salish, Shoshone-Bannock, Pend d’Oreille, and Blackfoot for hunting and fishing. At one point, three out of every four Montanans worked for the Anaconda Copper Company. By that time, ten thousand miles of shafts tunneled beneath the city, some more than three thousand feet deep. To dig a pit meant to relocate entire neighborhoods, something that didn’t stop the Anaconda Copper Company and their hunger for dominance. The Anaconda Copper Company would eventually fold after Chile nationalized their mining operations in 1971.
