After waking from one too many wet dreams, flushed and throbbing in a dank warehouse beside 60 other men, the static of flowing water sounds like dignity. Every weekend, I’d drive the San Marcos Pass into the fire-scarred Santa Ynez Valley to visit my cousin, my only friend in a county I couldn’t leave without my parole officer’s permission. During good times, the lake provides around 80 percent of the district’s water. Perhaps there are parts of the US where climate change still seems invisible and abstract; California isn’t one of them. I emailed the UCLA Living Donor Program about donating one of my kidneys, but the staff decided my congenital heart disease posed too great a risk. Investigative reporter Abrahm Lustgarten has calculated that, if Americans avoided eating meat just one day per week, it would save water equivalent to the annual flow of the Colorado River every year. I didn’t know how to cook and have always hated salads, so twice a day I ate spaghetti tossed in olive oil out of a dented, stainless steel mixing bowl. But then one morning the blanched gray bedroom carpeting began to darken and swell. Returning to the much-cited incarceration rates of the early 1970s would mean releasing four out of five Americans currently incarcerated, of whom more than half were convicted of what we call a “violent offense.” In a country deeply committed to countless forms of racial, environmental, and structural violence, who among us is truly interested in reckoning with what violence is and who commits it, with accountability and who should carry their fair share? The phrase “carbon footprint” wasn’t thought up by environmentalists; suits at the oil company BP coined it in 2004.
