 Keyword Extraction and summarization NLP Project

 The methods implemented include:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A statistical measure to reflect the importance of a word in a document relative to a corpus.
RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction): A domain-independent keyword extraction algorithm based on word co-occurrence.
YAKE! (Yet Another Keyword Extractor): A domain-independent keyword extraction method leveraging statistical features of words.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A powerful language model used here (potentially through fine-tuning or feature extraction) to identify semantically relevant keywords or phrases.
