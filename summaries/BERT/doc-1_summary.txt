Before I became the insufferable type of person who knows it takes a gallon of water to produce a single almond, I was a twentysomething state prison inmate, listening to the sound of a running faucet. Most bathroom sinks at Livingston had metering faucets with stout knobs you had to press to keep the water running. I always returned to water, the numbers looping in my head: more than 220,000 gallons of raw sewage from the California Men’s Colony dumped into a creek, 800,000 gallons unloaded by a prison in Alabama. Prison bathrooms often have what folks inside call “heinie hiders”: partitions that don’t rise even to an inmate’s shoulders when seated on the freezing, stainless steel toilets. I picture the drain in the ADA sink backing up, water spilling down its sides. Whatever time you’re reading this, whatever year, somewhere in America—all over America—a faucet is running in a prison bathroom, to hide the sounds of a man masturbating. My bladder would rouse me in the night, and before I hooked my shower sandals from under my bunk, I’d lie in the dark and listen to water sigh through the cinder block. Then I shuffled back to my dorm, to the bathroom, and watched the water pool in the ADA sink. How many gallons of water does the Livingston faucet waste every hour?
